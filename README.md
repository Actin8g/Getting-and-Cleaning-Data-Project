# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project contains a single script called "run_analysis.R", which reads the six files needed for analysis (X, Y and subject for both training and test data) and then perform a series of transformation to make the combined dataset tidy in a long data format.

Thre is also a markdown file called "CodeBook.Rmd", which explains the transformations perfomed in "run_analysis.R" and contains a codebook for the variables in the resulting outputted tidy dataset.
